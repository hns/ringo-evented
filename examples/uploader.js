/*
* A slightly contrived example of how to handle chunked and non-chunked requests in the same server.
*
* The pseudocode, in a nutshell:
*
* - In the 'request' message handler, check to see whether the 'chunked' attribute is true.
*   - If it is:
*     - The request is chunked. (No kidding.)
*     - The request has NO content, but everything else will be present (headers, params, etc.).
*     - Begin processing the request.
*     - In the 'chunk' message handler, check to see whether the 'last' attribute is true.
*       - If it is:
*         - This is the final chunk.
*         - It has NO content, but may have trailing headers. (I know, a bit of an oxymoron. Also, these
*           aren't implemented yet.)
*         - Finish processing the request and close the connection.
*       - If is it not:
*         - The chunk contains content in its 'content' attribute.
*         - Process the chunk and leave the connection open.
*   - If it is not:
*     - The request is not chunked.
*     - The request contains all the content in its 'content' attribute.
*     - Process the request and close the connection.
